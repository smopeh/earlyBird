          <h2>The Sunrise Sprint</h2>
          <p>Lena laced up her running shoes and stepped onto the quiet street, the sky painted in soft oranges and pinks. As she jogged past sleepy houses, the world slowly woke up—lights flickered on, birds chirped their morning songs, and the cool air carried the scent of fresh dew. With each step, she felt lighter, as if she were running straight into the new day, full of endless possibilities.</p>

          <h2>The Coffee Ritual</h2>
          <p>James stood in his small kitchen, the rhythmic gurgle of the coffee machine filling the silence. As the rich aroma of freshly brewed espresso curled into the air, he leaned against the counter, savoring the warmth of the ceramic mug in his hands. The first sip was always magic—bold, smooth, and full of promise. Today, he thought, would be a good day.</p>

          <h2>The Hidden Note</h2>
          <p>Maya shuffled to the table, still wrapped in her blanket, and reached for the steaming cup of tea her husband had left for her. A small folded note peeked from underneath the saucer. Smiling, she opened it: “Good morning, beautiful. Hope today brings you joy.” Her tiredness melted away as she sipped her tea, already feeling the warmth of the day ahead.</p>

          <h2>The Window Watcher</h2>
          <p>Old Mr. Dawson sat by his window, the same way he did every morning, watching the sleepy town come to life. The bakery across the street flipped its sign to “OPEN,” joggers passed with steady strides, and the paperboy hurried past with a nod. He smiled, feeling the quiet comfort of routine, knowing that in this ever-changing world, mornings always arrived just the same.</p>
